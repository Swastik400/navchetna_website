About Navchetna

Innovation served hotter than coffee ☕

Every great journey starts with a simple idea—and ours started on 6th September 2024. Five friends—Ayushmaan, Varun, Suman, Swastik, and Dhraval—were sitting together, talking about school, college, and life, and suddenly realized something: education could be so much better with the right tools and technology. From that conversation, late-night brainstorming sessions, and countless cups of coffee, Navchetna was born.

Back then, we were just a bunch of dreamers with laptops and big ideas. No fancy offices, no investors, no roadmap—just a shared vision and a lot of determination. We wanted to create solutions that actually help learners and make learning exciting, not just another tech project. That day marked the beginning of our story.

Today, Navchetna is proud to be based in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, and has grown into a company that does both products and services. Our flagship products—Osmium, Natraj, and Plaur—are designed to make learning smarter and more accessible. And our services? Everything from web, iOS, and Android development to AI/ML solutions, cybersecurity, and more. Basically, if it involves technology and innovation, we’re on it.

How We Make It Happen

We like to keep things simple, practical, and transparent:

1. Plan – We listen to your ideas, understand your goals, and map out a plan together.

2. Strategy – We figure out the best approach, with clear steps and milestones.

3. Development – We build it, tweak it, and make sure it works exactly how you want it to.

4. Deployment – We launch it, monitor it, and stick around to support it.

With our official collaboration with AWS India, we can ensure that everything we build is reliable, scalable, and ready for real-world use.
