Varun Yadav
Co-Founder & Director, Navchetna

I am Varun Yadav, Co-Founder and Director at Navchetna. My early years of schooling were in Noida until Class 10, after which I moved to Alwar, Rajasthan, to prepare for JEE. Living away from my parents at such a young age with limited resources was not easy. It was a difficult period, but it taught me resilience and gave me a deeper understanding of the challenges that students face every day.

Not achieving my target in JEE was a turning point in my life. It felt like a setback at the time, but it eventually became the seed for something much larger. In college, I met Ayushmaan, Swastik, Suman, and Dhraval. As we shared our stories, we realized that our struggles were not unique. Millions of students across the country were going through the same journey of stress, confusion, and lack of proper guidance. That realization became the spark for Osmium, an AI-driven EdTech platform designed to make learning more personal, adaptive, and supportive.

What began as an idea at a hackathon soon grew into something much bigger. From Osmium emerged Navchetna, the company that now carries forward our mission to reshape education. With Osmium and our new innovation, Natraj, we are building solutions that turn setbacks into stepping stones, giving students the tools and mentorship they need to succeed.

My journey proves that you do not need to have everything figured out to begin. What matters most is the courage to take the first step and the persistence to keep moving forward. Every challenge along the way has been a lesson, and every failure has become an opportunity to grow. Today, through Navchetna, I am committed to ensuring that no student feels alone in their journey and that every learner has the support to transform their dreams into reality.
