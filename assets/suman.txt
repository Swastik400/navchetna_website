I’m Suman Yadav, Co-Founder and Head of Design at Navchetna. Coming from a humble background, I’ve always believed that technology can change lives - especially for students like me who dream of creating something meaningful despite limited resources. My biggest motivation is to uplift our nation and empower the next generation with modern AI-driven solutions, while also supporting my family who stood by me through every step.

At Navchetna, I channel this vision into design - crafting experiences that are not only functional but also inspiring. My story is proof that you don’t need to have it all figured out to start - you just need the courage to begin. If there’s one thing I hope to pass on, it’s this: don’t fear failures, they’re part of the path. What matters is daring to build, to learn, and to create the future you believe in.
