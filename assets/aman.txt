Aman Gupta – Executive, Navchetna

I am Aman Gupta, a Navchetna executive, and I spend my days working to empower students and our country by exposing them to the potential of cutting-edge AI technologies. I come from a middle-class family and have always been motivated by two things: taking care of my family and doing what motivates others to develop.

My path started in pharmacy, yet curiosity moved me past books. With a biological mindset and passion for technology, I found myself breaking problems at the forefront of science and innovation. One of my most proud accomplishments has been developing Natraj, where I worked on addressing biological problems with new, pragmatic solutions.

It's what keeps me going: A straight forward conviction: failures are not an end, but stepping stones. With Navchetna, I wish to provide a hope and aspiration to anyone who reads my story reminding them that it's alright to begin small, dream big, and pursue their own ideas without fear.
