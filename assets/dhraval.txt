Dhraval Narsinha
Co-Founder | Frontend Dev

I am Dhraval Narsinha, born on January 1, 2006, in Diu, into a middle class family. Life was not always easy as my family faced financial struggles, but those challenges only strengthened my determination to grow and succeed.

My education began at Tulip English Medium School, where I studied from Lower KG to 5th standard. After that, I continued my studies at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Diu. I completed my 10th standard there, but my academic performance did not allow me to continue in the science stream. It was a setback, and I had to leave Navodaya. I then enrolled at Government Higher Secondary School in Diu, where I completed my 11th and 12th standards and graduated with the Class of 2024.

Despite these challenges, my interest in technology never faded. Driven by that passion, I pursued higher education at Rai University in Ahmedabad. It was there that I met some of my closest friends, Ayushmaan, Swastik, Varun, and Suman. Together, we participated in a hackathon that became the birthplace of Osmium, an AI driven EdTech platform.

From the very beginning, we decided Osmium would not remain just another hackathon project. We committed ourselves to building it at an industry level. We kept refining it, adding advanced AI features, and even creating our own large language model. Every step was filled with challenges. We faced setbacks, technical difficulties, and moments of doubt. Yet, we never gave up. Our persistence turned Osmium into a revolutionary platform with the potential to transform education itself.

To carry this vision forward, we founded NineLLMS Solutions Limited Liability Partnership, also known as Navchetna. Today, our team is actively working on Osmium, determined to create an impact that reaches learners everywhere.

Even now, I remain deeply committed to learning and developing new technologies. My journey from a curious child building models to becoming a driving force behind an innovative EdTech platform is proof that passion and persistence can shape dreams into reality.
