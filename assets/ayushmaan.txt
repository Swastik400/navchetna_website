I was born on February 14, 2005, in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, into a middle class family. Life was not always smooth. My family went through financial and personal struggles, and those challenges shaped me into who I am today. Instead of breaking me, they became the reason I developed a relentless determination to grow and succeed.

I completed my schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya Number 1 AFS Jodhpur until Class 11. Until Class 7, academics were not my strength. Everything changed when I met my mentor, Mr. Santosh Singh. His tuition classes gave me not only knowledge but also a new outlook on learning. That shift transformed me completely.

From a young age I was endlessly curious about technology. I would dismantle toys, explore electronic components, and play with circuits and motors. In Class 7, I discovered Arduino, and that single moment became a turning point. I began programming. At first, my world was hardware. Slowly I shifted towards software and started learning languages like Python and many others.

In Class 11, I chose Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics with Computer Science. The pandemic arrived, and schools moved online. What could have been a setback turned into an opportunity for me. I spent those hours diving deep into programming. I earned Google’s Associate Android Developer certification, a milestone that gave me both confidence and clarity about what I wanted to do with my life.

During Class 12, I opted for dummy schooling to prepare for JEE. My first attempt earned me 99.16 percentile in JEE Mains and 207 marks in JEE Advanced, though I missed qualifying in physics. I refused to stop there. I took a drop year and worked harder. In my second attempt, I became Jodhpur’s topper in JEE Mains with 99.91 percentile. My JEE Advanced attempt, however, faced a legal controversy which is still documented online as Ayushmaan Soni versus Union of India.

At the age of 17, while still in Class 12, I began working as a software developer at Secure E Techno World Private Limited in Jodhpur. That job was my first real step into the professional world, and it was during this time that I also started shaping my own startup ideas. After a year, I left my job to dedicate myself fully to my entrepreneurial journey.

I started as a freelancer, going door to door to pitch development services. Those days were difficult. I failed more times than I can count, but I refused to quit. I realized that instead of focusing on local clients, I needed to look beyond. Soon, I connected with startups in the United States, and that shift opened doors for me. Projects began to come in, and my work started becoming profitable.

That success led to the founding of my first company, NINEONE15SQ Technologies Private Limited. What started with small projects grew into a company generating revenue in crores.

To keep exploring bigger ideas, I intentionally joined a private university. There, I met some of my closest collaborators, Varun, Swastik, Suman, and Dhraval. Together we participated in a hackathon where the idea of Osmium was born.

From the very first day, we promised ourselves that Osmium would not be just another hackathon project. We treated it like an industry level platform. We kept upgrading it with advanced features and even trained our own large language model. It was difficult. We faced countless technical and personal hurdles. But we stayed strong, and Osmium slowly became a revolutionary platform that had the power to change the education system.

To take this vision forward, I founded NINELLMS Solutions Limited Liability Partnership, also known as Navchetna. Today, our team is building Osmium into a product that can make a real difference for learners across the world.

Outside of technology, mathematics is a part of me. I often say that mathematics is like a girlfriend to me. It is something I cannot live without. I love exploring its mysteries and working on unsolved problems.

One day, while reading about the Riemann Hypothesis, a question came to me. Why cannot we define factorials for negative numbers. That single question led me to develop my own mathematical theory, The Theory of Factorial of Complex Numbers. My first version was weak, and my teacher Mr. Pankaj Thakur pointed out the flaws in seconds. But instead of feeling discouraged, I refined it again and again.

I remember a wedding function where I sat alone waiting for my cousins. I had a pen in my pocket, and the tissue papers there were of excellent quality. Out of habit, I began writing, and that is where I developed the first proper version of my theory. When I showed it to my teacher this time, he could not disprove it.

My research kept expanding. I created the concept of three dimensional Argand Space. I found connections between factorials, geometry, and complex numbers. I worked on a proof for why zero factorial equals one and also introduced a new idea of factorial as directional. I even submitted my research to the Mathematical Gazette, where it is currently under review.

Today, I continue to learn, to create, and to innovate. My journey from a curious child dismantling toys to becoming the founder of multiple companies and contributing to mathematics has been full of challenges. But every obstacle has been a lesson, every failure a stepping stone. My goal is not only to work with existing technologies but to build something new, something that expands the possibilities of both software and mathematics.

I believe that true growth comes when curiosity meets persistence. My story is not just about success. It is about never giving up, no matter how many times life tests you.
